## 🧮 My First Project: Calculator

This is my first self-built project — a **calculator made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
I created it entirely on my own, without using any AI tools or templates. It may be simple, but it's a reflection of my creativity and commitment to learning.

## 🚀 What's Next

This calculator is just the beginning. I’m excited to keep building, improving, and sharing more projects that showcase my growing skills in web development.
